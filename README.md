# Project-PLATO

## What is PLATO?
PLATO stands for "Purification of Lousy Arguments Testing Onslaught". What this means for its services, is that it is a tool used to simulate SQL Injection Attacks against a web page and determining weaknesses arising from a lack of sanitation for inputs supplied by forms and delivered to the database for the system.

If a particular web page is prone to SQL Injection Attacks, then attacks to their system can cause data loss, data corruption, or denial of service. Without the proper protection, these attacks can cause severe damage to the database not just temporarily, but even long term, leading to a complete shutdown for a service for an indeterminate amount of time.

With proper sanitation of input from users, web pages are able to protect their database from potentially harmful users. Our system seeks to be an aid in this problem domain for web developers, providing a platform to attack their own system and be able to monitor what potential attackers are able to do from the user's public interface.
